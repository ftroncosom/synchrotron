# SynchroTron

## What is this?

An experimental image-style single-file HTML application inspired by
[TiddlyWiki](http://tiddlywiki.com/), but structured around a
Smalltalk-style code-as-data model and a git-like JSON version-control
system.

## Bugs

 - Merging two branches each having a CSS change doesn't apply the
   subsidiary branch's changes in the active instance until commit.
